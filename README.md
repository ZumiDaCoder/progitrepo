# progitrepo
A project git repo to learn how to use git. 

## Things I learned so far
Git commands that I've learned include:
1) `git init` 
2) `rm -rf .git` -> removed the .git folder from the home folder as that was incorrectly positioned
3) `ls -lash` lists files in the folder with all its properties
4) `take progitrepo` created the progitrepo and is a combination `mkdir progitrepo && cd progitrepo`
